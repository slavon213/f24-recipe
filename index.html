              <h2>Instructions</h2>
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      <span></span>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are
                      well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
                  </li>
                  <li><span></span>Heat the pan: Place anon-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
                  <li>
                      <span></span>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
                      pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <span></span>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly
                      runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <span></span>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it
                      over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                  </li>
                  <li><span></span>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
